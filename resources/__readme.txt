The original database had 26 million reviews, which made the database too large for replit.com to handle reliably.  So there are two versions of the database:

MovieLens.db: Ratings table has 100,004 ratings. Note that some movies do not have reviews, e.g. movie with ID 604.

MovieLens-all.db: Ratings table has all 26M ratings.
